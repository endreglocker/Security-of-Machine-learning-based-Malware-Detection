- [ ] If the file's size is too small, upscale the image
- [ ] If the file's size is too big, create an avrage of the values and then generate the image
- [ ] Evasion attacks: ART - Adversarial Robustness Toolbox
- [ ] FGSM attack
- [ ] Change the last layer of the model to sigmoid
- [ ] Carlini-Wagner attack
- [ ] Instead of using slack bytes, add random bytes to the end of the file
- [ ] The goal is to use the least amount of bytes to evade detection
- [ ] Pytorch or Tensorflow?
- [ ] The loss function minimizes by the input vector
- [ ] Create images manually so you will know which pixel is which sequence of bytes
- [ ] Give a pedding to the file if it's too small for the picture
- [ ] Read paper about evasion attack (the one that changes random bytes to evade detection)
